# Web design and development 

Each of the HTML documents contain a navigation menu which allows the user to easily navigate between web pages within the same website. It also contains hyperlinks to other external web pages such as DeNTAS GitHub repository which contains all the files associated with the development of the software.

1. Index.html: welcomes the user and contains a ‘GET STARTED’ button that takes the user to the next web page.
2. About.html: contains short paragraph describing the project mission.
3. Choose_uploads.html: allows the user to input the experimental groups as they fit (from 1 to 3). The user then can browse the files and upload them successfully.
4. Upload.html: uses a python ‘for loop’ to fill a form with the name of the samples and a dropdown box allowing the user to select their experimental group. The information from this form is then requested by Flask and fed into the data analysis.
5. Results.html: displays the R graphics output generated by the R analysis and table showing all significantly expressed genes generated by the BLAST analysis.
